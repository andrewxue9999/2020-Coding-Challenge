You'll see a short list of NHL teams, their scores, and buttons to increase their scores. 
Right now, clicking on a button doesn't increase the score immediately, 
but you need to refresh the page to see the change. The goal is to reflect 
this change immediately on the front-end. Once that's done, we would also like 
to sort the teams so that whenever there's a score change, the list would change 
so that the teams are listed in non-increasing order of scores from top to bottom 
(you don't need to sort them alphabetically when there is a tie). To do these, 
you would need to make changes in both server.py file and scoreboard.js file. 
When you're done, please send a pull request to this repository with your name and 
uni in the comment. Thanks and good luck!


1. Update scores live on the website
2. Sort the teams in non-increasing order from top to bottom (no tiebreaking necessary for teams with the same score)
